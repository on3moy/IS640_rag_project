### 4. 🎬 Live Demo or Examples (2-3 minutes)

**What to show:**
Present **3-5 example queries** with actual results from your system.

**Required examples:**
1. ✅ **Factual question** (works well) - Show your system at its best
2. ✅ **Complex/inferential question** - Demonstrates reasoning
3. ✅ **Edge case or failure** - Show what doesn't work well and analyze why

**Slides needed:** 3-5 slides (one per example query)

**Each example should show:**
- ❓ Question asked
- 📄 Retrieved context sources (which documents/chunks)
- 💬 Generated answer
- ⏱️ Response time
- 🎯 Your assessment (good/poor answer and why)

**Format options:**

#### Quantitative Metrics:
- 📈 **Hit rate** (% successful retrievals)
- ⏱️ **Average latency** (response time)
- 📚 **Source coverage** (how many documents were actually used)
- 🎯 **Success rate** (your qualitative assessment)

#### Qualitative Analysis:
- Side-by-side examples of **good vs. poor answers**
- **Error analysis** - Why did certain queries fail?
- **Parameter experiments** - Did you try different chunk sizes or Top-K values? What happened?

**Slides needed:** 2-3 slides

**Required visuals:**
- ✅ Metrics dashboard or summary table
- ✅ At least **one chart** (bar chart, pie chart, line graph):
  - Hit rate by question category
  - Latency distribution
  - Source usage frequency
  - Success rate comparison
- ✅ Good vs. bad answer comparison

---

### 6. 💡 Insights & Learnings (1-2 minutes)

**What to discuss:**
- What worked well / what didn't
- Surprising findings or "aha!" moments
- Lessons learned about RAG systems
- How chunking strategy affected results
- Trade-offs you discovered (e.g., chunk size vs. accuracy)
- Limitations of your system
- Ideas for improvement

**Slides needed:** 1-2 slides

**Format suggestions:**
- Bullet points with key takeaways
- "What we learned" visual summary
- Lessons learned infographic

---

### 🗒️ Extra Credit (Live Demo)

**Showcase Agent**

- Explain functions used
- Showcase LLM in action using functions.
   - Show inputs and ouputs

## 📦 Submission Requirements

**Submit with your project Report via Canvas **
**📊 Presentation Slides**
   - Format: PDF
   - File name: `GroupX_RAG_Presentation.pdf`
   - Total slides: 10-15 slides
   - Professional, consistent theme

---

## 👥 Team Participation

- ✅ **All 3 team members MUST present**

---

## ⏰ Time Management

- **Total time:** 10-15 minutes
- ⚠️ **Over 15 minutes:** Presentation will be stopped, -10% penalty
- **Practice your timing!** Aim for 12-13 minutes to be safe

---

## 🎨 Presentation Quality Guidelines

### ✅ Required:
- Clean, professional slide design
- Readable fonts (minimum 18pt for body text)
- High-contrast colors (dark text on light background or vice versa)
- Proper grammar and spelling
- Citations/sources if using external images or data

### ❌ Avoid:
- **Walls of text (use bullet points!)**

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we use more than 15 slides?**
A: You should aim for 10-15 content slides (not counting title). A few extra is okay if needed, but don't go overboard. Quality > quantity!

**Q: Do we have to do a live demo?**
A: Preferred, a short video are perfectly acceptable and often safer!

**Q: What if our system doesn't work well?**
A: That's okay! Be honest about it, analyze why, and discuss what you learned. Insightful analysis of failures is valuable.

**Q: Can we use ChatGPT or AI tools to help create slides?**
A: You can use AI for design help or grammar checking, but the content, analysis, and code must be your own work.

**Q: What if a team member doesn't participate?**
A: Contact the instructor before the presentation. Grade adjustments can be made for individual team members.

**Q: How technical should the code snippets be?**
A: Show your most interesting/challenging implementations. Add comments to explain. Keep snippets short (10-20 lines max per slide).

**Q: Should we include references/citations?**
A: Yes, if you use external images, quotes, or data sources. Not needed for your own code/results.
